description: Origin TLS Compliance Modes constrains the set of TLS key-exchange algorithms Cloudflare may use when establishing the TLS connection to the zone's origin. The value is a list of named compliance modes (currently `fips` and `pqh`). Multiple modes are combined as the intersection of their permitted algorithm lists. An empty list (or no rule configured) means no compliance constraint is applied.

# Get Origin TLS Compliance Modes setting

`GET /zones/{zone_id}/settings/origin_tls_compliance_modes`

Operation ID: `zone-cache-settings-get-origin-tls-compliance-modes-setting`

Origin TLS Compliance Modes constrains the set of TLS key-exchange algorithms Cloudflare may use when establishing the TLS connection to the zone's origin. The value is a list of named compliance modes (currently `fips` and `pqh`). Multiple modes are combined as the intersection of their permitted algorithm lists. An empty list (or no rule configured) means no compliance constraint is applied.
