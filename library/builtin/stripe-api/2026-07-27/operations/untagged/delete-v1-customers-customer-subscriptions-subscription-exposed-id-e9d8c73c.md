    <p>Cancels a customer’s subscription.

Otherwise, with the default <code>false</code> value, the subscription is terminated immediately. In either case, the customer will not be charged again for the subscription.</p>

    <p>Note, however, that any pending invoice items that you’ve created will still be charged for at the end of the period, unless manually <a href="/api/invoiceitems/delete">deleted</a>.
