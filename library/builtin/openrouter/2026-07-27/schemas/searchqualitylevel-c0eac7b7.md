description: How much context to retrieve per result. Applies to Exa, Parallel, and Perplexity engines; ignored with native provider search and Firecrawl. For Exa, pins a fixed per-result character cap (low=5,000, medium=15,000, high=30,000); when omitted, Exa picks an adaptive size per query and document (typically ~2,000–4,000 characters per result). For Parallel, controls the total characters across all results; when omitted, Parallel uses its own default size. For Perplexity, maps directly to the Search API's native search_context_size parameter. Overridden by `max_characters` when both are set.
